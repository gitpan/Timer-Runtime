=head1 SYNOPSIS

Timer::Runtime wraps a program with START and END blocks used to get the
start/stop times and caculate the runtime duration.  This information is printed
to STDOUT.  Note that if the program exists using 'exec', then the stop time
won't be seen due to the END block in Timer::Runtime not being called.

    use Timer::Runtime;

    #  output
    > <script_name> Started: Thu Aug 12 20:34:49 2010
    > <script_name> Finished: Thu Aug 12 20:34:49 2010, elapsed time = 00:00:00.000114
